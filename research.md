White Water Writers has worked with a wide range of academics over the last ten years. We've been observed in person, our complete novels have been assessed, and we've provided raw data to researchers looking to examine how effectively our writers proofread their prose. 

For all groups studied, the were significant (p<0.05) positive change in the writer's self-evaluation of their:

* understanding of how to write a novel, 
* ability to work under pressure, 
* ability to communicate their ideas both in writing and verbally, 
* teamwork skills, 
* ability to give and receive constructive feedback. 

Similar increases were recorded in writers' Locus of Control (how much the writers felt they were in charge of their future, as opposed to being controlled by outside events), and in how they felt about intelligence: after the camp, writers were much more likely to believe that people's intelligence could change over time.
