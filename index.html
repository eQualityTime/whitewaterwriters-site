<p>We take ten pupils out of lessons for a week and they write and publish a novel. For real.<p> 

<p> In the process, the writers vastly improve their writing: everything from plotting a character arc to setting a scene to making sure that a sentence has exactly the rhythm they are looking for. On top of that, they have to properly work as a team, improving their ability to give feedback, take feedback, organise tasks and trust their group.</p>

<p> Groups start with a blank page on Monday morning, are lead through a series of exercises and activities and publish their own collaboratively written novel on Friday afternoon. Nobody outside the group touches a key during the week - everything is entirely the work of the students involved.</p>
