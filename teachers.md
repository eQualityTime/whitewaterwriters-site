<p> We are interested in young people who need something different.  They might be gifted and talented students who aren't being stretched, they might be writers who are having trouble with how education is structured. We've worked with writers from Dunfermline to Nigeria to Amsterdam, from ages 10 to 21, and from top-tier university to category B prison.</p>

<p>Using the TooManyCooks process, we bring out the writing skills of our authors using a combination of structured planning and peer-lead review to produce jaw-dropping long form prose.</p>

<p> As a teacher, you know lots of students who might really benefit from this, but you have probably also seen lots of external groups over-promise and under-deliver.  That's actually our big problem as an organisation - nobody believes what we do is real until they see it. We have lots of wonderful repeat customers, and we adore going back to the same schools year after year, but we would like to reach more and more writers.</p> 

So here's what we do try and be a reassuring as possible. 

First, we work a lot with researchers who collected a lot of data and write it up nicely.  We've got a whole page for [our research]() and you can see how we've explored the overall long term effects on grades (students average about half a grade higher in their English GCSE)  

Second, we'll send a free sample book to any teacher that asks for one. Having a glance through the finished article gives you a clear, visceral understanding of what we do and what your students can do.
