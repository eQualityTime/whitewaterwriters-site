We are interested in young people who need something different.  They might be gifted and talented students who aren't being stretched, they might be writers who are having trouble with how education is structured. We've worked with writers across the UK, along with Nigeria, the Netherlands, and Japan.  

As a teacher, you know lots of students who might really benefit from this, but you have probably also seen lots of external groups over-promise and under-deliver.  That's our big problem as an organisation: nobody believes what we do is real until they see it. We have lots of wonderful repeat customers, and we adore going back to the same schools year after year, but we would like to reach more and more writers. So please get in contact and we'll send you a free book.
