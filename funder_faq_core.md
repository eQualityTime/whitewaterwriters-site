## What are the main activities that your organisation undertake? (maximum 300 words)
Our flagship projects are White Water Writers, a young adult fiction publisher that has ensured over 2,000 children have held in their hands a book they have written, and Open Voice Factory, an open source software project for people with communication disabilities. Both these projects started with seed funding for a pilot and then became self sustaining. 


## Why don't you have dbs checks: 

All staff that work with end users (or their data) obviously have DBS check, but our cover artists,  bookkeepers and programmers don't. The submission of DBS checks for these ineligible positions would be considered unlawful under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.
